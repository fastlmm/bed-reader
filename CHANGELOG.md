- Add support for cloud files to both Rust and Python.

## [1.0.0] - 2023-11-5

### Changed

- (Python) Core project now depends only on `numpy`.
  If you want to download samples files or create
  sparse matrices, say `pip install bed-reader[samples,sparse]`.

- (Python) Added new `read_sparse()` method for creating
  `sympy.sparse.csc_matrix` and `sympy.sparse.csr_matrix`. This
  method can save memory when a *.bed file contains mostly zeros.

- (Rust) Rust methods that returned `Result` now return
  `Result<_,Box<BedErrorPlus>>`. Before, they returned
  `Result<_, BedErrorPlus>`. This saves memory.

## [0.2.27] - 2023-10-29

- (Python) Add support for Python 3.12.
